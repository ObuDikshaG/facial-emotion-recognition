**Face Emotion Recognition using Python \& OpenCV**



A Python-based application that detects human faces and predicts emotions 

using a deep learning model trained by me.



This system can detect changes in facial expressions in real-time or from 

image data, and classify emotions such as:

\- Happy

\- Sad

\- Angry

\- Surprise

\- Neutral



\## Programs in the Project

1\. \*\*Image-based emotion detection\*\*:  

&nbsp;  Input an image or dataset, and the program detects the face and predicts the emotion.

2\. \*\*Real-time emotion detection\*\*:  

&nbsp;  Uses webcam feed to detect faces and predict emotions in real-time.



\## Features

\- Real-time face detection using OpenCV

\- Emotion recognition from facial expressions

\- Model trained on custom dataset

\- Supports both image input and live webcam



\## Challenges Faced

\- Understanding how OpenCV detects faces

\- Preprocessing images for model training

\- Real-time webcam integration

\- Training the model and achieving accurate predictions
